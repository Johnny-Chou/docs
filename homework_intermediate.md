### Part 1

I am proud I have changed some of my docs(including this one) to use markdown format.

It happened yesterday, after I finished my resume with markdown format.

The reason I decided to use markdown format is markdown now is very popular.

Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format,
then convert it to structurally valid XHTML(or HTML).

In order to use markdown format you need to learn some syntax.

After changed some of my docs, I felt I was evolved.
