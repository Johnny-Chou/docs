I'm Page Ask, I'm 26, I'm male

The Past:
=========

I had been working on mobile phone software for about three years.

In the first two years,
I was a C programmer writting applications for MTK feature phone platforms.
In this period I was every productive,
I wrote lock screen, idle screen, privacy protection, a animation framework and so on.

In the last one year,
I was a Java programmer wrtting applications for Android smart phones.
I was also a manager using git to manage our source code.

In the first half year, I worked on the QRD platforms.
I wrote lock screen and architected our company's development work flow.
Before my work, our company didn't use only source code control system.
After my work, we used git to manage our source code,
used gerrit to review our source code,
used jenkins to do continuous integration.

Here is the details:
Our development machines were installed with WinXP,
so we had to use msysgit + tortoisegit on the client side.
When our developers made changes and committed the changes,
they pushed the changes to gerrit and,
this trrigers the jenkins to start build.
if the build was successful the team leader reviewed it,
then merged it to the git repository.

In the second half year, I worked on the MTK platforms.
I developed lock screen, Launcher, Phone, Contacts, SMS, frameworks.

Now:

I'm reading and learning the Ruby code on github,
such as grit, jakyll, rubygems.

the best is to become a GitHubber.
