Unlike dpkg, apt-get does not understand .deb files,
it works with the packages proper name and can only install .deb archives from a source specified in '/etc/apt/sources.list'. 

apt-get will call dpkg directly after downloading the .deb archives from the configured sources.

To update the list of packages known by your system, do the following :
apt-get update

To upgrade all the installed packages on your system:
apt-get upgrade

To install the gedit package and all its dependencies:
apt-get install gedit

To remove the gedit package from your system:
apt-get remove gedit

To remove gedit and also its configuration files:
apt-get --purge remove gedit

Upgrading Debian to a new version can be done with the command:
apt-get dist-upgrade

Each time you install an application using apt-get,
the corresponding deb package is downloaded and stored in a location on your hard disk,
usually in the directory '/var/cache/apt/archives/'.

The following command will remove all the archives and free up hard disk space:
apt-get clean

To delete only those packages in the cache which are found useless or partially complete, do:
apt-get autoclean

To find all packages that contain the word "editor", do the following:
apt-cache search editor

To print detailed information about a package, the syntax is:
apt-cache show <package name>

To print the packages that a given package depends on, the syntax is:
apt-cache depends <package name>

To print detailed information of the versions available for a package and the packages that reverse-depends on it:
apt-cache showpkg <package name>

To get statistics of the packages available in the repositories:
apt-cache stats
